                    <h2>What is Frugal Innovation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Frugal innovation is all about innovation, collaboration and 
                        creativity. We highly value the idea of developing products and 
                        solutions with great quality and low cost. Frugal Innovation is 
                        an approach to research and development that goes against the traditional 
                        way of thinking about innovation. Rather than increasing the complexity 
                        of a product, Frugal Innovation aims to make great solutions availible 
                        everywhere.
